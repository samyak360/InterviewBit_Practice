I must say, this is one of the most interesting problems.  

<strong>Thought Process: </strong>
<ol>
<li>Initially, I thought that this is the simplest questoin that is ever asked in an interview.</li>
<li>As I implemented it, it was in O(n<sup>2</sup>), and resulted in timeout.</li>
<li>Now, it was a big trouble, becasue I could'nt think of any other approach.</li>
<li>So I ultimately took the help from stack overflow.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Solution:</strong>
* This is the question, which required maths. Think how to could open the modulus operator.
